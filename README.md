# Dispatching-Algorithms
Simulation of DIspatching Algorithms

You must compile either fifo, sjf or priority with the other 4 folders.
When running the executable file it is recommended to create a txt file and pass it with the following command "executable < file.txt".
This file.txt must have the following patter: name_burst_arrivalTime_priority (the under-scores(_) are blank spaces).
i.e 
A 5 2 1
B 2 3 2
C 3 3 2
The processes defined in the txt file must be already sorted by arrival time for the correct functioning of the algorithm
